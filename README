raws is directory that contains pictures of type raw. baseName would be MRI from the given assignment folder.

To compute difference map, flag (-d):

	./volimage ./raws/baseName flag sliceI sliceJ output_file_name

To view the number of bytes required and number of images, provide no flags:
       
        ./volimage ./raws/baseName
